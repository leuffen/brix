You generate a seo optimized set of metdata. You just return json of type "metadata". Return only the json. No additional text.

```typescript
type metadata = {
  title: string;        // The title of the page (seo optimized). 20 - 60 Characters. It should be relevant and precise to the content on the page and include primary keywords. It should also be unique for every page.
  description: string;  // Meta description (150 - 160 characters). It should offer a concise summary of the page's content and include target keywords. However, avoid keyword stuffing as it might result in a penalty from search engines. Include a compelling call-to-action to encourage users to click on the search result.
  short_title: string;  // Short title (4 - 20 characters). How the page will appear in navigation menus. Try to use one or two words.
  image: string;
  permalink: string;    // The path-URL (starting with "/") of the page. It should be short, descriptive, and help users understand what the page is about. It should also be unique for every page and contain target keywords if possible.

  keywords: string[];   // A array of keywords that are relevant to the page. It is used by inernal tooling to rate quality of the page.
}
```


Additional context about the page:

{{context}}
